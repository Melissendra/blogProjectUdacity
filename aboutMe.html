                    Hello. Here I'm going to talk a little about my life,  my hopes, my projects, my hobbies.
                    <br>
                    I'm 40 years. I work as a nurse since 19 years but today I want to become a developer. To achieve my goals, I study for the last 3 years Python language, Javascript, Html, Css and many other things.
                    <br>
                    Four years ago, I realized that I wanted a shifting in my career and since I love all things about computer science since I was a teenager I decide to try becoming a developer. I choose Python language because it has the reputation to be not to difficult to grab its concepts. And I simply fell in love. I spend lot of times working but it doesn't feel like working. Yes it can be frustrating, you spend your time to resolve bugs after bugs but when finally your project works, you are so proud of you.
                    <br>
                    I have a passion for books and all things about animals. In this blog, You'll find the last books I read and what I thought about it, some photos of my life loves: my dog and cat.
