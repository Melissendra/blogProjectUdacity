                <h4>Synopsis</h4>
                <p>In <i>The Power</i> the world is a recognisable place: there's a rich Nigerian kid who lounges around the family pool; a foster girl whose religious parents hide their true nature; a local American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family. But something vital has changed, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power - they can cause agonising pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world changes utterly.
                    <br>
                    This extraordinary novel by <b>Naomi Alderman</b>, a Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year and Granta Best of British writer, is not only a gripping story of how the world would change if power was in the hands of women but also exposes, with breath-taking daring, our contemporary world.</p>

                    If one word could resume my opinion of this book, it would be: wow. Not sure it's a word but wow.
                    It's one of the best book I read.
                    The hook is simple: the novel begins when girls and women suddenly gain the power to shock and kill others with only a touch; it takes only a second's thought to imagine how this would turn the world on its head.The hook is not that gain of power. It's how it change the relation between people. It doesn't show women like better than what we have actually in our world. Rather It show that women are no better than men with abuse or their power hungry side. It's a disturbing book. it's a very interesting book for it's sociological side.
