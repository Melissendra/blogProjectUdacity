                <h4>Synopsis</h4>
                <p>In <i>The Power</i> the world is a recognisable place: there's a rich Nigerian kid who lounges around the family pool; a foster girl whose religious parents hide their true nature; a local American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family. But something vital has changed, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power - they can cause agonising pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world changes utterly.
                    <br>
                    This extraordinary novel by <b>Naomi Alderman</b>, a Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year and Granta Best of British writer, is not only a gripping story of how the world would change if power was in the hands of women but also exposes, with breath-taking daring, our contemporary world.</p>

                    If one word could resume my opinion of thos book, it would be: wow. Not sure it's a word but wow.
                    It's one of the best book I read.
