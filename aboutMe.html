					<p class="intro">
						Hello. Here I'm going to talk a little about my life, my hopes, my
						projects, my hobbies. I'm studying at OpenClassRooms School and
						Udacity.
						<br />
						I'm 41 years. I work as a nurse since 19 years but today I want to
						become a developer. To achieve my goals, I study for the last 3
						years Python language, Javascript, Html, Css and many other things.
						Four years ago, I realized that I wanted a shifting in my career and
						since I love all things about computer science since I was a
						teenager I decide to try becoming a developer. I choose Python
						language because it has the reputation to be not to difficult to
						grab its concepts. And I simply fell in love. I spend lot of times
						working but it doesn't feel like working. Yes it can be frustrating,
						you spend your time to resolve bugs after bugs but when finally your
						project works, you are so proud of you.
						<br />
						Cooking is one of my greatest passion with books and animals. In
						this blog, you'll find my favorites recipes and so much more.
