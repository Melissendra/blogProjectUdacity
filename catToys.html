                <p> 
                    Let your cat go to town on this toy, it won’t break down. It also makes a great place to hang out and claw with their nails so your couch cushions and curtains get a break. The toy has scratching pads on the outside of the circle and balls they can bat around inside that make clear sounds when moved. The toy is made of 100% high-quality and environmentally-friendly corrugated paper that’s made to last. You can make the toy your own by removing the balls and adding food, treats or other stimulants if you’d like. The toy is also designed to get your cat up and moving so they reap all the benefits of regular pet exercise.
                    <strong>Pros:</strong> Built durably for scratching, balls inside that are engaging for cats, easily customizable, makes a great place to nap as well.
                    <strong>Cons:</strong> Since the balls can’t come out of the toy without your help, some cats may lose interest fairly quickly.

                <p>
                    This interactive robotic cat toy can drag around a feather or toy easily while your cat chases it. It’s got a 360-degree self-rotating ball built in with a double motor drive that will keep it moving across floors, carpets and other surfaces. The whole toy is made of high-quality materials that won’t scratch or damage easily if your cat attacks it. It’s got an LED color changing lamp rather than a laser to protect your cat’s eyes, and the rechargeable battery can last for three to four hours on a single charge. The toys attach via a detachable magnet that will trail toys behind the device so your cat will chase, catch up, and continue to chase some more.
                    <strong>Pros:</strong>360-degree self-rotating ball, powerful motor, rechargeable battery, can connect to a variety of toys.
                    <strong>Cons</strong>Takes about two hours to charge after usage.
